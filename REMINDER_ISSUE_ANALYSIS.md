# Reminder Issue Analysis - October 29, 2025

## Problem
Reminders are not being sent even after setting the reminder time.

## Root Cause
The reminder system requires **TWO** configurations to work:
1. ✅ **Reminder Time** - Currently set to `07:46` UTC (which is around 1:16 PM IST)
2. ❌ **Reminder Channel** - Currently **NOT SET** (NULL in database)

The database query in `database.py` line 334 filters out guilds where either setting is missing:
```python
WHERE reminder_time IS NOT NULL AND reminder_channel_id IS NOT NULL
```

Since `reminder_channel_id` is NULL, your guild is completely excluded from the reminder loop, so no reminders are sent.

## Solution
You need to set the reminder channel using this Discord command:
```
/setreminderchannel channel:#your-channel-name
```

For example, if you want reminders in a channel called `#reminders`:
```
/setreminderchannel channel:#reminders
```

## Current Configuration
- **Guild ID**: 1422243427122151485
- **Reminder Time**: 07:46 UTC (converts to ~1:16 PM IST)  
- **Reminder Channel**: **NOT SET** ❌
- **Users with pending streaks**: 5 users who haven't logged today

## Complete Setup Steps
1. Run: `/setreminderchannel channel:#your-preferred-channel`
2. Verify: Run `/checkreminder` (if available) or wait for the next reminder time
3. The bot will automatically remind all users with active streaks who haven't logged for the day

## Additional Notes
- The reminder task runs every minute
- It checks if the current IST time matches your configured reminder time
- It only reminds users who have an active streak (current_streak > 0) and haven't logged today
