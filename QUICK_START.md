# 🚀 LupinBot Quick Start Guide

## What is LupinBot?

LupinBot is a **Duolingo-style coding streak tracker** for Discord. It helps you build consistent coding habits by tracking your daily programming activity.

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Just Share Code Daily
- Post any code snippets, images, or projects
- No need for `#DAY-1`, `#DAY-2` labels (optional)
- The bot automatically tracks your activity

### 2. Check Your Progress
- `/mystats` - Your current streak and achievements
- `/streak_calendar` - Visual calendar of your activity
- `/leaderboard` - See where you rank

### 3. Protect Your Streak
- `/use_freeze` - Use a streak freeze if you miss a day
- Start with 1 free freeze
- Earn more by staying consistent

   - Challenge yourself to beat your record
