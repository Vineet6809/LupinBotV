# Bot Changes by Gemini

This file documents all the changes and improvements made to the bot by Gemini.

## Streak Tracking System

### 1. Stricter Streak Detection

*   **Problem:** The bot was previously detecting streaks based on a broad range of keywords, leading to accidental streak updates from casual conversation.
*   **Solution:** The streak detection logic has been updated to only recognize streaks when a message includes a clear `#day-n` pattern (e.g., `#day 5`, `#DAY-10`).

### 2. Code-Only Updates in #daily-code

*   **Improvement:** In the `#daily-code` channel, the bot will now automatically update a user's streak if they post a message containing a code file or an image with code, even without the `#day-n` command.
*   **Benefit:** This provides a more seamless experience for users who share their daily progress directly in the designated channel.

### 3. Day Number Auto-Correction

*   **Problem:** If a user posted a message with the wrong day number, their streak would be reset.
*   **Solution:** The bot will now automatically correct the day number and send a friendly warning to the user. For example, if a user on day 5 posts a message with `#day 4`, the bot will update their streak to day 6 and let them know about the correction.

### 4. Reduced Spam

*   **Problem:** The bot would previously send multiple "Already Completed" messages if a user who had already logged their streak sent more messages with coding-related keywords.
*   **Solution:** The bot will now only send a single confirmation message when a user logs their streak. Any further messages from that user on the same day will be ignored by the streak-tracking system.

### 5. Flexible Code Association

*   **Problem:** The bot required the `#day-n` tag and the code (image, file, or block) to be in the exact same message.
*   **Solution:** The bot will now look for code in the message sent immediately before or after a message containing the `#day-n` tag. If a user sends their code and their day number in separate, consecutive messages (within a 2-minute window), the bot will link them and update the streak.
*   **Benefit:** This makes the streak-tracking process more flexible and forgiving.

### 6. AI-Powered Code Detection with Fallback

*   **Problem:** Relying solely on an external AI service for code detection could lead to system failure if the service is unavailable.
*   **Solution:** The bot now uses a hybrid system. It first attempts to use the highly accurate Gemini AI for code detection. If the AI service fails, it seamlessly falls back to a robust, language-agnostic heuristic model that analyzes the structural properties of the message (e.g., indentation, symbol density) to detect code.
*   **Benefit:** This creates a resilient, fault-tolerant system that combines the accuracy of AI with the reliability of a built-in failsafe.

These changes make the streak-tracking feature more accurate, user-friendly, and less intrusive.
