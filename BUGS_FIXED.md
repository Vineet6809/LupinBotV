# Bugs Fixed in Deployment

## Errors Found and Fixed

### 1. ❌ NameError: name 'timedelta' is not defined
**Location**: `cogs/streaks.py` - `streaks_history` command
**Error**: Missing import for `timedelta` from datetime module
**Fix**: Added `timedelta` to imports at line 5
```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

**Impact**: 
- The `/streaks_history` command was completely broken
- Users trying to view their streak history would get an error
- This is now fixed and the command works properly

### 2. ⚠️ Database Query Issues
**Issue**: Some API endpoints may fail if database is empty
**Status**: Protected with try-catch blocks
**Fix**: All endpoints have error handling

### 3. ✅ Dashboard Working
**Status**: All API endpoints working correctly
- `/api/connected_guilds` ✓
- `/api/server_stats/<guild_id>` ✓  
- `/api/leaderboard/<guild_id>` ✓
- Guild dropdown loading properly ✓

## Tests Performed

1. ✅ Syntax Check - All files compile without errors
2. ✅ Import Test - All modules import successfully
3. ✅ API Test - Dashboard endpoints respond correctly
4. ✅ Guild List - Connected guilds load in dropdown

## Current Status

- **Bot Status**: All cogs loaded successfully
- **Dashboard Status**: Running and responsive
- **API Status**: All endpoints functional
