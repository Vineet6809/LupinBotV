the #day-n should be character insensitive also '-' is not be that important
The bot should greet when it's being tagged.
Tracks daily coding streaks for each user based on messages containing #DAY-n.
Stores streak data per user and server .
Increments streak if the day sequence is correct, reacts with ðŸ”¥.
Warns user if the day number is skipped or incorrect, reacts with ðŸ”„ and resets streak.
Leaderboard command (!leaderboard) shows top streaks in the server.
Restore command (!restore @user day_no) allows admins to restore a user's streak.
Daily reminder task sends a message at 18:00 UTC to remind users to log their streak.
Weekly summary task posts top 3 streaks every Sunday at 18:00 UTC.
All features work across all servers and text channels.
Only mention the streak once per day per user in daily-code to avoid spam.
Detect code more reliably (support more languages, not just Python).
Add a friendly embed with streak info, last log date, and achievement badge.
Optionally, allow users to opt-out of automatic streak mentions.
Only mention streak if the post is not a reply or bot command.
Slash Commands: Upgrade all commands to Discord slash commands for better UX and autocomplete.
Persistent Streak Reminders: Use scheduled tasks (e.g., APScheduler) for reliable reminders, even if the bot restarts.
User Settings: Allow users to customize reminder times, notification preferences, and streak visibility.
Streak Recovery: Let users recover a streak if they miss a day due to valid reasons (admin approval or limited use).
Leaderboard Filters: Add filters for weekly, monthly, or all-time streaks.
Multi-language Code Detection: Improve code block detection for more languages and file types.
Achievements & Badges: Add more achievement levels and visual badges for milestones.
Web Dashboard: Create a simple web dashboard for server admins to manage bot settings and view analytics.
Error Logging: Add logging for errors and important events to help with debugging and monitoring.
Apply all these features.
