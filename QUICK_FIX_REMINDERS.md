# üî• QUICK FIX - Reminders Not Working

## The Problem
Your reminders are not being sent because **the reminder channel is not configured**.

## The Solution (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Set the Reminder Channel
In your Discord server, run this command:
```
/setreminderchannel channel:#your-channel-name
```
Replace `#your-channel-name` with the channel where you want reminders.

Example:
```
/setreminderchannel channel:#reminders
```

### Step 2: Verify It's Working
Run this command to check:
```
/checkreminder
```

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Reminder Time: 01:16 PM IST (already configured)
- ‚úÖ Reminder Channel: #your-channel (newly configured)
- ‚úÖ Status: Reminders are **active**

---

## Why Did This Happen?

You set the reminder **time** but forgot to set the reminder **channel**.

The bot requires BOTH:
1. ‚úÖ Reminder time (`/setreminder`) - **YOU HAVE THIS**
2. ‚ùå Reminder channel (`/setreminderchannel`) - **THIS WAS MISSING**

Without both configured, the database query filters out your server, so reminders never trigger.

---

## What We Fixed

We added:
1. **`/checkreminder`** - A command to verify your reminder configuration
2. **Better warnings** - Both `/setreminder` and `/setreminderchannel` now warn you if the other is missing
3. **Better logging** - The bot now logs reminder activity for easier debugging

---

## After You Fix It

Once you set the reminder channel:
- Reminders will automatically send at **01:16 PM IST** (your configured time)
- All users with active streaks who haven't logged today will be mentioned
- Currently, **5 users** would receive reminders
