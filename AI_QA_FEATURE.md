## Technical Details

### How It Works
1. You tag @Lupin with a question
2. Lupin extracts the question text
3. Downloads and processes any attachments (code files, images)
4. Sends everything to Gemini AI
5. Receives and formats the response
6. Replies to your message with an embed

### Limitations
- **Response length**: Maximum ~1900 characters (Discord limit)
- **File size**: Limited by Discord's upload limits
- **Processing time**: May take a few seconds for complex questions
- **API availability**: Requires valid GEMINI_API_KEY

### Error Handling
If something goes wrong, Lupin will:
- Show a clear error message
- Log the issue for debugging
- Suggest trying again

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific
‚ùå `@Lupin help`
‚úÖ `@Lupin explain what a decorator is in Python`

### 2. Provide Context
‚ùå `@Lupin fix this`
‚úÖ `@Lupin this code throws a TypeError, can you help me fix it? [attach code]`

### 3. Ask One Question at a Time
‚ùå `@Lupin explain classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction`
‚úÖ `@Lupin explain what inheritance is in OOP with an example`

### 4. Use Code Blocks for Inline Code
If you're not attaching a file, use code blocks:
```
@Lupin why does this give an error?
\`\`\`python
def foo():
    return bar
\`\`\`
```

### 5. Reference Specific Parts
For large files:
```
@Lupin can you explain the calculate_total function in this file?
[Attach: shopping_cart.py]
```

## Privacy & Security

- Lupin doesn't store your questions or code
- All processing is done through Gemini AI
- Messages are not logged beyond standard bot logging
- Your code files are temporarily downloaded and then discarded

## Troubleshooting

### Lupin Doesn't Respond
- Make sure you tagged @Lupin correctly
- Check that the bot has permissions to read and send messages
- Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is configured

### "Can't Access AI Capabilities" Error
- The bot needs a valid GEMINI_API_KEY
- Contact your server admin to configure it

### Response is Cut Off
- Responses are limited to ~1900 characters
- Try asking a more specific question
- Break complex questions into smaller parts

### File Not Recognized
- Check that the file extension is supported
- Ensure the file isn't corrupted
- Try uploading it again

## Examples in Action

### Example 1: Python Help
```
User: @Lupin explain list comprehensions in Python

Lupin: ü§ñ Lupin AI Assistant
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists in Python. 

Basic syntax: [expression for item in iterable if condition]

Examples:
```python
# Square numbers
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

# Filter even numbers
evens = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]

# Transform strings
upper = [s.upper() for s in ['hello', 'world']]
```

Benefits: More readable, faster than loops, Pythonic style.
```

### Example 2: Debug Help
```
User: @Lupin why isn't this working?
[Attaches: code.js with async issue]

Lupin: ü§ñ Lupin AI Assistant
Looking at your code, the issue is that you're not awaiting the promise. 

Current code:
```javascript
function getData() {
    fetch('/api/data')
    return data  // data is undefined here
}
```

Fix:
```javascript
async function getData() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data')
    const data = await response.json()
    return data
}
```

The `await` keyword pauses execution until the promise resolves.
```

### Example 3: Image Analysis
```
User: @Lupin what's wrong with this error?
[Attaches: screenshot showing Stack Overflow]

Lupin: ü§ñ Lupin AI Assistant
You have a stack overflow error, typically caused by infinite recursion.

Looking at your screenshot, the issue is in the `calculate` function - it calls itself without a base case.

Fix: Add a termination condition:
```python
def calculate(n):
    if n <= 0:  # Base case
        return 0
    return n + calculate(n - 1)
```

Always ensure recursive functions have a stopping condition!
```
